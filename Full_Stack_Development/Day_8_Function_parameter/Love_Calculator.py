""" Love Calculator
💪 This is a difficult challenge! 💪

You are going to write a function called calculate_love_score() that tests the compatibility between two names.  To work out the love score between two people:

1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number and print it out.

e.g.

name1 = "Angela Yu" name2 = "Jack Bauer"

T occurs 0 times

R occurs 1 time

U occurs 2 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 5

L occurs 1 time

O occurs 0 times

V occurs 0 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 3



Love Score = 53 """

# 1. String Count Method (Current Approach)


def calculate_love_score(name1, name2):
    name1 = name1.lower()
    name2 = name2.lower()

    combined_name = name1 + name2
    true_count = 0
    for letter in "true":
        true_count += combined_name.count(letter)

    love_count = 0
    for letter in "love":
        love_count += combined_name.count(letter)
    love_score = int(f"{true_count}{love_count}")
    print(f"{love_score}")
    return love_score
